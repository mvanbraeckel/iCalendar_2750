 */

NOTES:
 --> (1). Follows A1 modules 1 and 2 (conforms to its specifications, and in turn the "RFC 5545" documentation)
 --> (2). Calendar file follows format and name requirements and specifications for (1)
            - since nothing was said, I assumed by default the file must be located in assign1 (same level as makefile)
 --> (3). "*.c" files go in src folder | "*.o" and "*.so" files go in bin folder | "*.h" files go in include folder | makefile and readme and "*.ics" files go in assign1
            - (like in A1 module 1 submission structure guidelines)
 --> (4). As said by professor, Calendar pointer being passed into createCalendar must not be allocated
            - (also, apparently w/ some research, checking if it has been uninitialized or allocated when it is passed is impossible)
 --> (5). Any assumptions made (eg. for what to error return when / in what order, or about specific requirement specifications, etc.)
            have been confirmed with multiple TAs and/or professor himself

NOTE: The LinkedListAPI.h and CalendarParser.h files used while creating my *.c files are the ones downloaded from moodle A1.
            I assume that these have not been altered since first being posted.
            (As professor and TAs have said, and announcements are made about any confusions, rather than changing it)
